# Morpheus Performance Benchmarking with differnt Property Graph Backends.

The goal of this  expriment is to Benchmark the performance of Cypher for Apache Spark (CAPS) ; or it is called currently 'Morpheus', on top of its supported property graph storage backends. 


As initial steps, we have made some initial micro as well as macro benchmarking queries for evaluating the performance of different storage backends of Morpheus.

We have used the LDBC-SNB BI  benchmark workload. In the first experiment (Atomic level) We run 18  Atomic level BI queries.

In the second experiment (Macro Benchmarking): we run 21 BI queries out of (valid to run in Morpheus Cypher).
